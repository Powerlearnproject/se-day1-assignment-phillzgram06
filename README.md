Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software Engineering is the developing of responsive programs in an computer system. THese instructions tell the computer what to do and how it can help solve a problem in any industry. it is important in the technology industry because it is the creation of softwares which contribute to the ease of modern lifestyle.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. It aided in the ease of GLOBAL COMMUNICATION
2. It also aided in RECORDING AND STORING LARGE AMOUNTS OF DATA
3. Gave People access to unlimited information and entertainment


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Requirements: REsearching User needs
2. Design: Creating HIgh-level design of thr software architecture and user interface
3. Implementation: writing the codes of the desired design
4. Testing: Testing the code to see if it meets the requirements
5. Deployment: Releasing the sodtware to the customers
6. Maintenance: Constant Support, Updating and Enhancement


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
1. Waterfall Methodology: Entails the sequential Approach with distibnct phasaes flowing like a waterfall
2. Agile Methodology: More of repetitive corrrections and modifications for flexibity and response to change 


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
1. Software Developer: writes the code for the software product
2. Quality Assurance Engineer: Plans the testing process
3. Projrst Manager: Oversees the planning, execution and delivery of the product to customers

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
1. IDEs are essential in the development of software products bacause it is the environment where the instructions are communicated into the computer. Example, VScode
2. VCS is important in tracking changes to course code. Example, GIT


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1. Requirement Changes
2. Technical Debt
3. Tight Deadlines
4. Strategies to overcome challenges


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1. Unit Testing: testing individual components and modules
2. INtegration Testing: Testing Interactions
3. System Testing: Testing the entire system architecture and functions
4. Acceptance Testing: testing to see if the product meets the needs and requiremennts of the customers


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
1. Promt Engineering is the effective communication of prompts to an AI model for it to effective perform your desired rquirements. The prompt should br direct and concise.
2. It is important as it helps one to be able to craft effective prompts that are useful to the user and to avoid misinterpretation of prompts or generic results.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
